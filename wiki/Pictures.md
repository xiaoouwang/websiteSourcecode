### focal vowels

- underlined Fn indicates that the formant is a resonance of the front cavity (and therefore especially sensitive to lip configuration). Fn is also excited by the supraglottic noise during fricatives and in the frication part of stops). The downward arrow ↓ in ↓Fn indicates that the formant is low.

### nomograms fant

- The minimal cross-section area at the constriction is fixed here to 0.65 cm². (b): the corresponding nomogram. Straight and dotted lines correspond respectively to open (in the solid lines) and rounded/protruded lips (in the dashed lines). Black, blue and green colors refer respectively to F1, F2 and F3.

- Nomogram adapted from Fant using the three-parameter vocal tract model. The tongue constriction size is fixed at 0.65 cm2 . Plain lines and dashed lines correspond respectively to no lip rounding and to a 0.16 cm2 lip area
  after Fant 1960: 82

- constriction is near the front end of the VT, the distance between F1 and F2 is much larger than the distance between F2 and F3. This region corresponds to i- and e-like sounds (zone “I” in Fig. 4).
- it is close to the glottis, F1 is high and the region corresponds to open sounds (zone “A”).
- When the lips are rounded, there is a region where the distance between F1 and F2 is much smaller than the distance between F2 and F3, and F1 and F2 are low in frequency (zone “U”).
  The regions where F2 is high and therefore close to F3 (zone I) or F1 and F2 converge (zone A and zone U) correspond to quantal regions, as described by Stevens [34].

### Coarticulation

Note that the lower resonance in the case of /ku/ as compared to /k/, which has a more backed constriction, is most likely due to rounding: the length of the front cavity is longer in the case of /ku/ than in the case of /kɑ/.

### theorie de la perturbation

- A constriction near a pressure node lowers the formant frequency, whereas a constriction near a pressure antinode raises it. A constriction at the point designated by Nx in Figure 3 will lead to a decrease in frequency of the corresponding formant (x refers to the assigned formant).

### formant manipulation
<img src="img/2019-06-11-11-10-18.png">
- simulation of protrusion and rounding in a neutral tube (Figure 4a) (points N1, N2, N3 and N4 in Figure 3). Rounding (Figure 4b) is twice as effective as protrusion. (Figure 4c) in lowering F1 (31 versus 64 Hz). But when combined (Figure 4d), the effect is enhanced: F1 is lowered by 154 Hz, because the ratio of area over length plays the essential acoustic role. As expected, all formants lower.
