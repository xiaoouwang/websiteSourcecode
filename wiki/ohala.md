## 1975 PHONETIC EXPLANATIONS FOR SOUND PATTERNS: IMPLICATIONS FOR GRAMMARS OF COMPETENCE

Phonological grammars try to represent speakers’ knowledge so that the ‘natural’
behavior of speech sounds becomes self-evident. Phonetic models have the same goals
but have no psychological pretensions. 

The quest to find a representation of speech sounds that makes their behavior selfevident goes back at least 3 centuries (Amman 1694; Jespersen 1889; Key 1855) but has
been most intense in the past 3 decades. Two approaches to “natural” representation
have been developed in parallel, one, the “mainstream” phonological one which employs
discrete linguistic primitives and at the same time purports to represent the knowledge of
the native speaker (Chomsky & Halle 1968 [SPE]; Clements 1985; Goldsmith 1979;
McCarthy 1988) and another, phonetic models which are expressed with continuous
physical primitives (Fant 1960; Fujimura 1962; Ohala 1976; Scully 1990; Stevens 1971;
Westbury & Keating 1985) but which do not pretend to reflect psychological structure. 

There is a well known aerodynamic constraint on voicing in obstruents. Some
languages, like Korean and Mandarin have only voiceless stop phonemes; in languages
like English that possess both voiced and voiceless stops, the voiceless [ptk] tend to
occur more often in connected speech than the voiced [bdg]. 

This constraint can be overcome (within limits) by expanding the oral
cavity volume to absorb the accumulating air. or
actively, by lowering the tongue and jaw, lowering the larynx 

But there are fewer
options for vocal tract enlargement the further back the obstruent is articulated.

 This
is the reason why /I/ is missing (in native vocabulary) in, e.g., Dutch, Thai, Czech. See
(Maddieson 1984; Ohala 1983, 1994) for additional phonetic and phonological data
reflecting this.

greater bias against voicing in fricatives than stops and in geminate (long) stops than in
singletons (Ohala 1983, 1994)

If back-articulated stops such as [I] and [)] are threatened in voiced stop series, it
seems that it is the front-articulated stop [R] that is threatened in the voiceless series.
This is not due as such to aerodynamic but rather to acoustic factors

an abrupt amplitude
transient is one of the cues for a stop; the stop burst of a [R] is less intense and thus less
noticeable than those for other, further back, places of articulation because a labiallyreleased stop lacks any down-stream resonator.  [R] seems thus frequently to become a
labial fricative (which happened in the history of Japanese). (Although the burst form the
voiced [b] would be subject to the same factors, a rapid amplitude gradient on the voicing
that follows it would still cue its stop character; with [R] and especially [R*], this
additional stop cue would be weak.)

Phonetic models, however, which are also formal, succeed in
deriving this behavior from primitives which are for the most part extra-linguistic, e.g.,
entities and relations from the physical universe (Ohala 1976; Scully 1990; Westbury &
Keating 1985).

Stops become affricated before high, close vowels but not before lower vowels

Does the obstruent character of the [ ] or the affricated release of the stops have to be
introduced explicitly by a special rule?
 it is necessary to briefly review some of the
aerodynamic factors giving rise to turbulence (Ohala 1994; 1997a; Scully 1990; Stevens
1971)

Turbulence increases when the velocity, v, (so-called ‘particle velocity’) of the air
increases. Particle velocity, in turn, varies as a function of volume velocity, U (how
much air is moving past a given point per unit time), divided by the physical
characteristics of the channel it moves through, simplified as d (= diameter), in (1).
(1) v = U / d

From these equations we see that turbulence can be increased by decreasing the crossdimensional area of the channel. 

Rather,
another way to create turbulence is by increasing U, the volume velocity

 (See Ohala 1995, 1997b) for
more details, further data and references, and discussion of how the same principles can
account for some cases of emergent ejectives and clicks.

The problem with the phonological representations here lies
in taking [±continuant] or [±sonorant] as primitives, whereas they are in fact derived from
the states of the valves which control air-flow

The probable reason for this
is that since noise is inherently a relatively high frequency sound, even if noise were
generated equally at both the velar and labial places, the noise at the velar constriction

would be attenuated by the low-pass filtering effect of the downstream resonator. (See
(Fant 1960; Stevens 1971).

 labio-velar nasals
will tend to sound like simple velar nasals
both labial  

A nasal assimilating to the labio-velar [Y], insofar as it shows any assimilatory
change and shows only one place of articulation, becomes the velar nasal [1], not the
labial nasal [O]. Tswana /-roma/ “send” + /wa/ (pass. sfx.) = / -TQ1YC/; Melanesian
dialects show the variant pronunciation /OYCNC/ ∼ /1YCNC/ for the name of Mala Island.

Some principles adduced by Fujimura (1962) help to explain this pattern. (See
also Ohala & Ohala 1993).) 

perceptive reasons :

In the  case of the labio-velar nasal there are two constrictions, one labial and one velar, but only
the rearmost constriction defines the extent of the branch (measured from the point where
it diverges form the pharyngeal-nasal cavity); the forwardmost (labial) constriction will
be largely irrelevant in determining the characteristic resonances.
