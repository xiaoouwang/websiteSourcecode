# Interactions Between Vowels and Nasal Codas in Mandarin Speakers’

Perception of Nasal Finals

Garner speeded classification studies

In the modern
Chinese phonetics, there is a total of 39 Finals, with the
proportion of nasal Finals standing at 41% (i.e., 16 nasal
Finals). There are 405 basic monosyllables without
considering the neutral tone and four lexical tones, among
which 177 are composed of nasal Finals accounting for 44%
[3].

With respect to Chinese characters, there are 1387
characters with nasal Finals which are responsible for 46% of
the 3000 frequently-used characters.

/n/ and /ŋ/ were best identified
after the vowel /a/ among the five vowels [4] Zee

Malécot
reported that the formant transitions between vowels and nasal
consonants were important cues for place identification
between /n/ and /ŋ/ [5].

Larkey et al. indicated that the second
and the third formant (i.e., F2, F3) were the primary acoustic
cues for the realization of categorical identification of
synthetic nasal consonants [6]

It was assumed that nasal codas (i.e., /n/, /ŋ/) in
standard Mandarin were different from nasal consonants in
English [7]

For instance, some perceptual studies showed clear evidence
for effects of vowel qualities on identification of /n/ and /ŋ/,
more specifically, the more similar the phonetic values (i.e.,
formants) of the vowels were, the less distinctive that the two
nasal codas were [8, 9], which was comparable to the result of
[4]

## AN ACOUSTICALLY BASED CONTRASTIVE STUDY OFL1 AND L2 NASAL CODA PRODUCTION (Ya Li) (very very bad)

**still some interesting, measuring formants in nasalized parts and making blunt interpretations**

English is a stress-timed language and its syllable duration is flexible depending on the stress number/location

Mandarin is a syllable-timed language, so the duration of the 4 Mandarin words should be roughly equal.

For example, Hansen’s (2001) study reveals that Mandarin speakers tend to produce English /ŋ/ as /n/ in words such as sing and song, which renders sing/song similar to sin/son.

For example, in Zee's (1981) perceptual study of nasal coda identification by native English speakers, /n, ŋ/ are often confused in the high vowel context.

Syrdal and Gopal’s (1986) perceptual study of American vowels and Sussman’s (1990) study of the front/back vowel distinction respectively use F1-F0 (the difference between the first vowel formant and the fundamental frequencies) and F3-F2 (the difference between the third and second vowel formant frequencies) to correlate vowel height and backness because vowels can be more clearly separated by these two acoustic parameters.

Clumeck (1976) found that low vowels have both a longer vowel duration and a longer duration of vowel nasalization than high vowels. Also, the duration of vowel nasalization is relatively long in American English and Brazilian Portuguese but short in Hindi, French, Swedish long vowels, and Amoy Chinese.

Twenty Mandarin Chinese speakers (10 females and 10 males) participated in this study.

Chen (1972) also claimed that Mandarin /ŋ/ is two times longer than /n/. However, Chen (1972) did not provide acoustic evidence to support his claim.

## Mandarin adaptations of coda nasals in English loanwords (Mou Xiaoming 也有份)

### generalities

According to most analyses (e.g. Duanmu 2000, 2007), Mandarin has five vowel phonemes: /i/, /y/, /u/, /ә/, and /a/.
The vowels take on a variety of allophonic guises depending on the surrounding consonants. In (1) we illustrate several generic CVV syllables.

In the context of nasal codas the low vowel takes a relatively front allophone before the dental nasal (typically transcribed as [an]) and a relatively back, unrounded allophone before the velar nasal (transcribed as ["ŋ])–a distribution termed Rhyme Harmony in Duanmu (2000, 2007).

<img src="img/2019-06-08-11-29-42.png">

given that the vowel is unspecified or noncontrastive for [back] in Mandarin (indicated by the archiphoneme A; see Wang (1993) & Duanmu (2000, 2007) for details)

<img src="img/2019-06-08-11-30-29.png">

<img src="img/2019-06-08-11-30-53.png">

First, there is the Dictionary of Loanwords and Hybrid Words in Chinese (Liu et al. 1984).

Our main finding is that it is the front vs. back category of the vowel that determines the outcome.

Front vowel [æ] (RP [a]) is represented with the letter a (e.g. hat) while the back, unrounded ["] (or rounded [d] in RP) is typically represented with o (e.g. hot).

However, sometimes ["] is also spelled with the letter a (e.g. class). Since we cannot always rely on English spelling, we have checked all examples with the OED.

For the period of the early 20th century the British presence in China was much stronger than the American one and thus British English is the more likely source for the English loanwords.

### data

#### congruence

When the English source consists of a front vowel combined with a dental nasal ([æn]) or a back vowel combined with a velar nasal (["ŋ]), we expect the Mandarin adaptation to contain a matching rime–i.e. [an] or ["ŋ], respectively. For English [æn] there are 31 loans in our corpus; all but five support this hypothesis.
<img src="img/2019-06-08-11-34-31.png">
<img src="img/2019-06-08-11-34-49.png">

For English ["ŋ] rimes there are seven examples in the corpus; five are adapted as expected with a velar nasal and back vowel allophone (6a).
<img src="img/2019-06-08-11-35-21.png">

<img src="img/2019-06-08-11-35-32.png">
#### incongruence
Either the front vs. back character of the vowel can be preserved and the nasal changed; or alternatively the nasal coda can be held constant and the vowel adjusted.
The data o ingly evidence the first strategy.

In all of the corresponding Mandarin loans, it is the nasal consonant that is changed, giving an ["ŋ] rhyme in the majority of cases (8a). In a few (8b), the vowel is mid [oŋ] or [ƒŋ].

### phonetics

For example, Chen (2000) reports F2 differences of c. 500 Hz. in [an] vs. [aŋ] rhymes when they appear before a stop such as da¿n.daˇ ‘single hit’ (tennis) vs. f "`ŋ.dà ‘magnify’.
They are located in the interior of the vowel and are not just a coarticulatory effect at the VC transition. ????

The magnitude of the F2 differences in Mandarin [an] vs. ["ŋ] rhymes was further documented by Mou (2006), who found a c. 400 Hz difference at the mid point of the vowel for her Beijing subjects (see Figure).
<img src="img/2019-06-08-11-41-20.png">
This difference makes sense under Flemming’s (2003) interpretation of the relation between coronal consonants and vocalic tongue body features as one of fronting the tongue body to accommodate a consonantal constriction at the alveolar ridge.
that the average F2 values for p dorsal low and mid vowels are relatively close to the values found in syllables lacking a coda
<img src="img/2019-06-08-11-42-30.png">

Finally, Mou (2006) reports gating experiments in which her subjects could reliably guess the presence and identity of the upcoming coda nasal when they heard less than half of a low or mid vowel.

On the other hand with high vowels, where there is a contrast among [i], [y], and [u], speakers could not reliably identify the following nasal–especially after [i] where there may even be neutralization of the [n] vs. [ŋ] contrast. ???

## Mou Nasal codas in Standard Chinese – a study in the framework of the distinctive feature theory

The goal of this thesis is to evaluate the role of language-specific enhancing gestures that are language specific in speech production and perception, by comparing the production and perception of the nasal coda in English and Standard Chinese,

A goal of this study is to incorporate findings about the role of enhancing gestures into an algorithm for classifying the nasal consonant place of articulation, which captures not only the universal features of nasalization but also some important languagespecific phonotactic constraints.

### generalities

Results for the low vowel /a/ show a mapping based on vowel rather than coda similarity. Acoustic analysis shows that the SC vowel /a/ shifts in the frequency of the second formant (F2) depending on the nasal coda, while the English vowel does not.

The SC mid vowel /ə/ shifts in F2 while the SC high vowel /i/ does not.

The nasal place of articulation was identified best when the nasal was preceded by the mid vowel /?/, was identified less when followed by the low vowel /a/, and was identified the worst when the nasal was preceded by the high vowel /i/.

Each sound category can be described by a set of binary articulatory parameters, which we refer to as distinctive features.

quantal theory (Stevens, 1972, 1989, 2002).

The distinctive features are thought to be universal for all languages, but different subsets of them are used to distinguish sounds in different languages.

### enhancing

Furthermore, although a distinctive feature has its defining articulatory and acoustic correlates, additional acoustic properties may arise through articulatory actions that are not specified directly by the feature. These actions, which we call enhancing gestures, may be introduced to augment the perceptual contrast defined by the distinctive feature when the feature occurs in certain phonetic or prosodic contexts that render it less salient (Keyser & Stevens, 2001).
(cf these d'etudiant de Vaissiere sur p t b d rabbid rabbit, duree... dans ses cours de spectro aussi)

Different languages differ in their phonotactic constraints and in their inventory of phonetic contrasts, and we would expect the enhancing gestures to be language dependent.

The interactions of the language ndependent distinctive features and the language-dependent enhancing gestures could lead to differences in the acoustic manifestation of the same feature in different languages.

Often, some additional attribute or cues might be introduced, in addition to the defining attributes, so that the acoustic manifestation of a distinctive feature may be quite different.

Keyser and Stevens (2001) have proposed that the enhancement process operates as a quality control device between the articulatory information and the acoustic information stored in memory.

Lip rounding is a gesture that most speakers of English use to strengthen this acoustic property.

The distinctive feature [-anterior] for the consonant /R/ requires the tongue blade to be placed so that the constriction is made behind the alveolar ridge.

primary acoustic correlate of a [-anterior] obstruent is that the lowest spectral prominence of the frication noise be in the region of F3.

But the placement of the tongue blade may only lead weakly to this acoustic property.But the placement of the tongue blade may only lead weakly to this acoustic property.

### quantal theory

The quantal nature of speech is thought to be a basis for the distinctive feature theory.

The articulatory-acoustic relations are said to be quantal because as an articulatory parameter is varied through a range of values, the associated acoustic parameters change from one state to another. This non-linear relation can be represented schematically in Fig. 1.1 (Stevens, 1989)

<img src="img/2019-06-08-11-56-22.png">

Within these two regions, the articulatory structures are close to the target state specified by the relevant distinctive feature, moderate changes in articulatory position can occur without significantly altering the relevant attribute in the acoustics.

In region II, on the other hand, small changes in the articulatory position can lead to large changes in the acoustic parameter. In this unstable region, the articulatory structures will tend toward either region I or III, and there is a threshold whereby the unstable state shifts to the target state specified by the distinctive feature.

An example of a threshold effect in a quantal auditory-acoustic relation can be illustrated by vowel nasalization. When a vowel becomes nasalized, acoustic coupling of the oral cavity to the nasal cavity through the opening of the velopharyngeal port introduces, among other things, an extra spectral peak or perturbation in the region normally occupied by the first formant.

The major effects on the spectrum are the addition of a spectral peak or shift in the frequency of F1 and a decrease of the amplitude of the F1 peak in the spectrum.

**Stevens, Fant and Hawkins (1987)** added a suitably located pole-zero pair to the vocal-tract transfer function of a synthetic vowel. They manipulated the spacing between the pole and zero and asked listeners from different language backgrounds to make nasal-non-nasal judgments. Listeners made similar identification responses regardless of whether a nasal-non-nasal distinction for vowels existed in theStevens, Fant and Hawkins (1987) added a suitably located pole-zero pair to the vocal-tract transfer function of a synthetic vowel. They manipulated the spacing between the pole and zero and asked listeners from different language backgrounds to make nasal-non-nasal judgments. Listeners made similar identification responses regardless of whether a nasal-non-nasal distinction for vowels existed in their language. The threshold for the nasal-non-nasal distinction appeared when the maximum perturbation introduced into the basic non-nasal F1 prominence in the vowel spectrum was in the range 6-9 dB. the maximum perturbation introduced into the basic non-nasal F1 prominence in the vowel spectrum was in the range 6-9 dB.

Studies of speaker differences in articulator coordination have been carried out by **Johnson, Ladefoged, Lindau (1993)** under the assumption that a relatively small set of articulatory features are universally used in the sound systems of the world’s languages.
From _x-ray microbeam_ pellet trajectories during the production of vowels of American English by five speakers
_"r" sound_ in English can be produced either by using retroflexion or tongue bunching, as long as the sound can be recognized.

Individual differences in speech production may be interpreted as indirect evidence that the acoustic goal determines the organization of speech articulation, rather than spatiotemporal targets or gestures.

### mandarin/english contrast

Table 1.1 indicates that nasals in both English and Standard Chinese are specified by the same features. They are all consonantal and sonorant. /m/ is produced with a closure at the lips, while /n/ is produced with a constriction made with the tongue blade and /M/ is produced with a constriction made with the tongue body.

The alveolar /n/ is produced with a closure formed at a point about 1.5 to 2.5 cm posterior to the lip opening. The velar /M/ is produced with a high tongue body position with a constriction farther from the lips, about 5 to 6 cm (Stevens, 1998).

The opening of the orifice for nasal consonants also tends to nasalize vowels that precede and follow these consonants (Krakow & Huffman, 1993).

The nasal codas in Standard Chinese have no other consonant codas to compete with for perceptual contrast.

In SC, only /a/, /i/ and /?/ can occur before both the velar and alveolar nasal and in addition, /a/ and /?/ are unspecified for the feature [back], as Table 1.2 shows.

The difference in the place of articulation of the nasal coda could potentially modify the frontness or backness of the Standard Chinese vowel that is unspecified in the feature [back].

The rhyme harmony constraint does not apply in English, which has a larger vowel inventory.

Manuel (1990) has proposed that although languages occupy a universally available articulatory-acoustic space, this space is divided up differently, so that languages differ in their inventories of distinctive sounds and systems of contrast. A language with a closer vowel space such as English would have a smaller range of production and a language with a more diffuse vowel space, such as Standard Chinese, could tolerate larger production ranges.

the influence of the nasal coda in SC on the preceding vowel would be considered an enhancing gesture. Together with some universal attributes of nasalization, this enhancing gesture helps to distinguish the place of articulation in nasal codas in Chinese.

On the other hand, the place of the articulation of the nasal coda would have a much less effect on a preceding high vowel [i], which is already specified for the feature [-back] in Standard Chinese.

where the vowel is [i], and the nasal [n] or [M], to be distinguished from one another based on acoustic cues not so much in the vowel region but rather in the nasal murmur region.

(Recasens, 1982; Kurowski & Blumstein, 1987; Repp & Svastikula, 1998, Harrington, 1994). These studies have focused mainly on English and other languages that have the nasal and oral vowel distinction, such as French and Portuguese.

Repp and Svastikula studied syllable-final vs. syllable-initial nasals [m n] and found that spectralchange provides less information about place of articulation in VN than NV due to lack of salient spectral change between vowel and nasal coda.

WANG(1993)
For the nasal onset, nasal airflow was nearly 100%. For the nasal coda, however, nasal airflow was only 68% of the total.
