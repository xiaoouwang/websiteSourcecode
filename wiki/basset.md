## 2001 Nasal airflow in French Spontaneous Speech.

spontaneous vs read speech
there is a valid correlation between air flow and opening when the cross sectional area is less than 0.4 cm2 (Warren et al 1987)
its absence does not signify that the velopharyngeal port is closed. Furthermore, lowering of the velum starts before velopharyngeal port opening (Benguerel et al, 1977).
All former aerodynamic studies for French dealt with read speech (Durand 1953, Benguerel 1974, Cohn 1990, Ohala & Ohala, 1991).
However, as it takes some time for the velum to lower and to rise again (50 ms according to Ohala, 1975), a minimum amount of coarticulation is expected.

As reported by Benguerel (1974), a short phase of negative airflow before a nasal was observed (figure 1). It corresponds to an increase of volume in the nasal cavity at the beginning of the lowering of the velum. It was considered as an indication of adequacy of the instrument.
The total corpus analysed consists of 11 minutes of spontaneous speech uttered by three females (1mn 46s; 1 mn 20 s; 3 mn 18 s) and one male (4 mn 36 s), speaking Standard French.
During a second recording session, each speaker was asked to read and record a great part of what he (she) had said spontaneously during his (her) first session. It was then possible to compare the read and spontaneous styles on the same material.
Audio, aerodynamic and glottographic signals were segmented and phonetically transcribed with the aid of spectrographic representation. Priority to the auditory impressions was given in case of conflicting evidence.
Nasal phones at the beginning and at the end of utterances were discarded as respiration can contaminate the data (Van Hattum et al, 1967). Occurrences containing more than two nasals were also discarded when it was impossible to separate anticipatory from carryover influence, as for example in [sE) sA) sE)kA)t fÂA)] “cinq cent cinquante francs” ‘five hundred and fifty francs’.

In V+Ṽcontext, there is a tendency (18/32, 56%) to anticipate nasalization during an oral vowel.
In most cases, NAF is starting during the preceding phone (ratio=1.3). Some perception tests should be conducted to find out if the nasalized preceding phone is still perceived as oral.
A nasalised vowel is not identified by French listeners as phonemically nasal ? because nasal vowels in French differ from oral, not only by the presence of nasal airflow but also by a special articulatory setting (Zerling, 1984).
Low vowels are realised with a lower velum (Passavant, 1863) and because they need a lower velum to be perceived as nasal (Benguerel & Lafargue 1981; Maeda, 1982)
The higher oral pressure during high vowels favours nasal leaks.
In C+V there is a clear difference depending on the voicing of C. This is in agreement with the results of Ohala & Ohala (1991). When C is voiced, anticipation prevails (78/100, 78%). In some cases like for example in “C’est bon ?” [sE bO)] ‘is it all right ?’ (see figure 6 (i)), the labial voiced stop /b/ preceding the nasal vowel /O)/ seems completely nasalized with no burst visible on the spectrogram and with the presence of formants. Out of context, it sounds like a nasal.
When C is unvoiced, anticipation only happens in one third of the cases (31/90, 34%) and there are many cases of delay (in read speech, for stops: 15/32, 46%). In the cases of anticipation, like in the example on figure 6 (ii) “vacances” [vakA)s] ‘holidays’, nasal airflow seems not sufficient to prevent the building up of oral pressure and the burst is still visible on the spectrogram.
In V+N a large variability was observed. There were as many cases of anticipation as synchronous onset of NAF (75/162, 46%).

While in [-nasal] [+nasal] contexts, no clear difference appears between anticipation and synchronous onset of NAF, or between styles, the results are very different for carryover, even if in Ṽ+V context there is only a slight tendency for nasal airflow to spread on the following phone (13/22, 59%).
In Ṽ+C, in almost all cases, there is a carryover of nasal airflow on the following phone (64/70, 91%, when C is voiced and 159/14, 92%, when C is unvoiced). However, there is a difference in the mean duration and ratio of airflow depending on the voicing. When C is unvoiced, the ratio of the carryover does not exceed 0.8 (the next phoneme is not completely nasalized); the ratio is 1 when C is voiced (the next phoneme is completely nasalized). As shown in Fig. 7, nasal airflow continues almost throughout the following stop in descendent vers [desãd vER] ‘going down to’ ‘7(ii) and in maisons qu’étaient [mEzO& ketE] ‘house that were’ (7(i)),even irrespective of a word boundary after the nasal vowel in the latter case.
The maximal level of nasal airflow corresponds to the beginning of the oral closure. The burst is visible on the spectrogram and it still sounds like a stop (at least to the authors). As suggested by a rewiever of this paper, the upward excursion in the nasal graph in the /k/ case may be related to velic raising for stop closure, as the velum slides along the pharynx wall, pushed by tongue-dorsum/velum contact. This articulatory configuration acts like a piston creating a nasal air stream independent of air from the lungs. This may not be the only explanation, since the same phenomenon was observed for non velar stops.

There are some well-known cases of complete assimilation of unvoiced stops in French in words like “maintenant” [mE)tnA)] ‘now’. The pronunciation can vary from [mEt´nA)] in hypoarticulated speech, to [mEnA)] in spontaneous speech (figure 8). In the latter case, the voiceless stop is completely assimilated (or considered as absent). Dell (1986) postulated that no assimilation could occur in a sequence of [nasal] + [unvoiced stop] + [sonorant]. Our data (figure 7) provide counter evidence.
In N+V context, carryover seems to be the rule. (118/122, 97%).

When compared with Cohn’s results, our data differ only with regard to NAF before the nasal (see table 9). The present study could establish no clear tendency on either way. The results are in agreement for NAF spreading after the nasal.

It was hypothesised that less coarticulatory phenomena (anticipation and carry-over) would happen in read speech, as compared to spontaneous speech. Our data does not confirm such a trend.
The nasal airflow tends to appear before or at the onset of a nasal in both styles. A clear difference was observed depending on the identity of the surrounding phonemes. A majority of anticipatory phenomenon were found in the context C+Ṽ with a clear difference depending on the voicing of the consonant. When C is voiced there is a majority of occurrences where NAF precedes the nasal vowel.
In conclusion, no clear differences could be established between speaking styles, neither for anticipatory nor carryover phenomena. More data are however needed to confirm the present results, to investigate more systematically inter and intra-speakers differences, the effect of rate of speech and styles, such as hyperarticulated and hypoarticulated speech. Perception tests are also needed to determine how nasalised vowels and consonants are perceived out of context.
A reliable way remains to be found to compute the magnitude of nasal airflow in order to confirm Benguerel & al (1977) finding that there is a difference in the opening of the velopharyngeal port between the syllable [na] and [nA)].
