### French

French is often cited as having vowels close to the CVs (note, however, that younger generations have lost the opposition between [ɑ] and [a]; the opposition between [œ] and [ø] is currently weakening).

### Types

- u
  Strictly speaking, the narrowest passage for /u/ is much fronter than for //, in the velar region. (↓F1⇓F2) 400Hz corresponds to Jones’s cardinal vowel /u/, to its rendition by Ladefoged, to the French and Swedish vowel /u/, but not to the English /u/, which usually has a higher F2. French /u/ does not have the same spectral quality as Spanish /u/, which is close to French /o/. (??? see spanish data from eric zee's bio?)
- y
  German y : greater F2-F3 distance than French y

  Swedish y : higher F2 than French (see Vaissier 200)

  French y : shortest F2-F3 distance and lowest F2

  **(F2F3) 1900Hz does not correspond to Jones‟s /y/, nor to Swedish or German, but clearly corresponds to the rendition of cardinal vowel /y/ by PL and to French /y/.**

  Front (F2↓F3) 1900Hz does not correspond to Jones’s /y/, nor to Swedish /y/ (where F3 is equidistant from F2 and F4, Fant 1973: 98). However, it clearly corresponds to the rendition of cardinal vowel /y/ by Peter Ladefoged and to French /y/. Note that languages contrasting /i/ and /y/ seem to prefer a prepalatal position for both (Wood 1986), but this is not true of Swedish (as described by Fant 1973: 94-99); there is lip protrusion in French and German, but not in the Scandinavian languages (Malmberg 1974:139). As far as I have observed on spectrograms, German /y/ does not correspond to (F2↓F3) 1900Hz either: F2 is separated from F3.

  - The notation for Swedish /y/ is given in Vaissière 2007.

  - Prepalatal /i/ has a higher F3 and lower F2 than mid-palatal /i/. A vowel with the highest F2 will be represented in our notation as (⇑F2) 2500Hz . This (non cardinal) /i/-like sound could be taken as a reference, with an F2 maximally high (around 2500 Hz), corresponding to a constriction at about 11cm from the glottis, but where F2 is clustered neither with F3 nor with F4. When F3 and F4 are clustered, F1 and F2 amplitude is minimal. Again enhancing the acuteness of the vowel
  - the lower F3 in midpalatal /i/ leads to a “duller” quality than in prepalatal /i/.
  - The next figure illustrates two types of /i/, as pronounced by Ladefoged (the sounds are available on the Internet).

  - In languages using prepalatal /i/, /i/ does not necessarily have the highest F2 as compared to the other vowels (see an example in Swedish, Fant 1973: 96, where /e/ has higher F2 than /i/). !!!!
    1973 Speech Sounds and Features. Cambridge. MA and London, UK: MIT Press.
  - Raising the larynx favors a high F2, by shortening the back cavity, but does not favor a low F1 (a Helmholtz resonance), because it reduces the volume of the back cavity. It is thus preferable to widen the tongue root to increase the volume of the back cavity (to lower F1), while keeping the back cavity short (for a high F2).

### Praat doesn't work

- y

### formant manipulation

- examples :
  - simulation of protrusion and rounding in a neutral tube (Figure 4a) (points N1, N2, N3 and N4 in Figure 3). Rounding (Figure 4b) is twice as effective as protrusion. (Figure 4c) in lowering F1 (31 versus 64 Hz). But when combined (Figure 4d), the effect is enhanced: F1 is lowered by 154 Hz, because the ratio of area over length plays the essential acoustic role. As expected, **all formants lower**.
    <img src="img/2019-06-11-13-36-51.png">
- F2 can be lowered by two constrictions (N2, N’2) along the VT, one at the lips (N2) and one at the back (N’2). F3 can be lowered by three constrictions (N3, N’3 and N”3), and F4 by four constrictions (N4, N’4; N”4 and N’’’4). F3 is maximally lowered and drop from 2321 Hz to 1671 Hz, and clusters with F2, creating a concentration of spectral energy around 1500 Hz. It corresponds to an r-colored vowel, i.e. a vowel whose main distinctive acoustic cues is a low third formant. The sound has the same color than the English phoneme , in rhotic varieties of English as spoken by Peter Ladefoged (compare the two spectrograms in Figure 5b and c). ɚ can be produced by a compound of labialization, bunching and backing of the tongue, corresponding respectively to N3, N’3 and N’’’3 in Figure 3. The fourth constriction, at the glottis end, represents the laryngeal cavity.
  <img src="img/2019-06-11-13-44-52.png">

* In most cases, it is not possible to manipulate one formant independently of the other formants, but in most cases, a constriction has more effect on one formant than the others.
  <img src="img/2019-06-11-11-10-26.png">

#### F1

- For front constriction (palatal vowels), less constriction = higher F1

/e - ɛ/

- For back constriction, fronting of the constriction + lips rounding = lower F1

/o - ɔ/
Vaissiere cross-language perspective

- Front constriction = F1 lowers Back constriction = F1 raises

#### F2

- lip rounding

- Raising the larynx favors a high F2, by shortening the back cavity, but does not favor a low F1 (a Helmholtz resonance), because it reduces the volume of the back cavity. It is thus preferable to widen the tongue root to increase the volume of the back cavity (to lower F1), while keeping the back cavity short (for a high F2).

#### F3

#### F4

aleveolar retroflexion lowers F4
[11] Fant, G. 1960. Acoustic Theory of Speech Production. The Hague: Mouton.

#### F3

- a constriction in the pharyngeal region
- plus lip rounding and
- a bunching of the tongue.
- Palatal retroflexion is one gesture that lowers F3 (alveolar retroflexion lowers F4) [11].

- The three necessary constrictions correspond to the three points along the vocal tract where the volume velocity nodes of F3 are located [7][7] Chiba T, Kajiyama M. The Vowel: Its Nature and Structure. Tokyo: Tokyo-Kaiseikan.

### articulation-based phonology

- The specification of the phoneme in terms of distinctive features does not always reflect the acousticperceptual similarity between the sounds: the (only) back consonant in French is actually acoustically close to the back vowel //; /l/ and /g/ in /i/ context share acoustic characteristics with /i/ and /j/ (such as a clustering of (F3F4), visible during /g/ when the closure is not complete): their short acoustic distance is not reflected in their definition (see examples in Vaissière 2007), but it is reflected in sound changes.
- Since Panini, in the 5th century BC, most of the sound changes in historical phonetics and natural processes have mainly been interpreted in terms of natural articulatory processes. The distinctive features are defined by the position of the articulators (Chomsky and Halle 1968), e.g. high, back, anterior, nasal, etc. The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) labels refer to articulation, such as height and backness of tongue body and lip position for the vowels. Finally, the basic cardinal vowels (Jones 1918) are also mainly defined in articulatory terms, at least according to their author.
  1969 SPE
- the listener decodes speech by identifying the underlying vocal tract gestures intended by the speaker (the Motor theory of speech production: Liberman and Mattingly 1985); the basic units of phonological contrast are articulatory gestures (Articulatory phonology: Browman and Goldstein 1992; Task-dynamic model: Saltzman and Munhall 1989).

### Acoustic-based phonology

- In their groundbreaking Preliminaries to Speech Analysis, Jakobson, Fant and Halle ([1952] 1967) viewed features as acoustic entities and defined them mainly in the acoustic domain. The criteria are the sharpness of the formant structure, the level of total intensity and the way the energy is concentrated in a central area of the spectrum, the range of frequencies where the energy is concentrated (e.g. the energy is concentrated in the low frequencies for grave sounds), the level of noise intensity, the presence of periodic low frequency excitation, the existence of additional formants and less intensity in existing formants (nasal/oral), etc.
- For example, the feature [grave] sheds light on the change of [x] into [f] (as in the final consonant of the English word rough), which are both [+grave] While there is no articulatory connection between the back of the tongue and the lips, both collaborate in lowering the energy. For Fant’s later views on distinctive features proposed in the Preliminaries, see Fant 1973.

- Stevens has developed a number of enlightening theories based on the acoustic properties of sounds. According to the Invariance theory, each distinctive feature has an invariant acoustic property. For example, the gross shape of the spectrum sampled at the consonantal release shows a distinctive shape for each place of articulation: a prominent mid-frequency spectral peak for velars, a diffuse-rising spectrum for alveolars, and a diffuse-falling spectrum for labials (Stevens and Blumstein 1978).

- The Quantal theory predicts that the languages of the world show a preference for regions of acoustic stability in the acoustic signal for phonemes. These regions correspond to quantal states where there are minimal acoustic consequences to the small perturbations resulting from the position of the articulators (Stevens 1989).
  1989 On the quantal nature of speech. Journal of Phonetics 17:3-45.
- According to Stevens’ Enhancement theory, the distinctive features are often accompanied by ‘redundant’ features that strengthen the acoustic realization of distinctive features and contribute additional properties which help the listener perceive the distinction. For example, lip protrusion enhances distinctive [back] by lowering further the second formant and therefore enhancing the contrast between [+back] and [-back] sounds; lip protrusion also serves to make post-alveolar [] more distinct from [s], by lowering the resonances due to the front cavity (Keyser and Stevens 2006).

### perception phonology/listener's role

- the speaker will increase or decrease his/her articulatory effort depending on the context (the Hypo- and Hyperarticulation theory: Lindblom 1990).
- A large number of substitutions between sounds are explainable in simple auditory terms and interpreted as misparsing of the acoustic signal due to perceptual limitations in rapid speech (the Theory of misperception: Ohala 1981; see also Durand 1955).
- Chang, Plauché and Ohala (2001) provide an interesting account of asymmetries in sound change based on asymmetries in perception. For a recent collection of papers on the importance of perception in shaping phonology, see Hume and Johnson 2001; for auditory based features, see Flemming 2002.

### aerodynamics phonology

- John Ohala has documented the aerodynamic laws underlying a number of sound changes related to voicing. Intra-oral air pressure build-up in non-sonorant consonants inhibits voicing. Non-sonorants in the world’s languages tend to be uttered without vocal folds vibration (i.e. as voiceless). The phonologically voiced nonsonorants tend to devoice when they are long. Glides and high vowels have a greater tendency to devoice than comparable lower vowels because of a higher intraoral pressure. Tense vocal tract walls and back place of articulation inhibit longer voicing of the phonologically voiced stops by preventing expansion of the vocal tract volume necessary for the maintenance of a sufficient transglottal pressure; voiced velar consonants are accordingly missing more often than labial consonants in the inventory of the world languages. The voicing of a voiced fricative is gained at the expense of the energy of its frication: fricatives favor voicelessness (more than the corresponding stops), etc. (Ohala 1997, see also Passy 1890:161-162).
  The coupling of a side cavity, such as the nasal cavity, the tracheal cavity, the sub-lingual cavity or a lateral cavity or the back cavity in the case of fricatives is responsible for the presence of zeroes in the speech signals: nasals, fricatives, affricates, laterals, nasalized and breathy vowels share the presence of zeroes, which sheds light on some sound changes in which they pattern together. About the spontaneous nasalization of vowels in fricative context, see Ohala 1996.

### coarticulation

- Minimum articulatory effort and economy of gestures (Lindblom 1983) lead to a decrease in the articulatory distance between the phonemes in a sequence. The overlapping of the gestures by the different organs required for the production of the successive phonemes (Hardcastle and Hewlett 1999) lead to a further reduction of the articulatory distance between the successive phonemes. The reduction of effort is not uniform and it is determined according to the prosodic status of each phoneme, mainly its position relative to word stress and to word boundaries. Sounds in word-initial and in syllable-initial position or in pre-stressed position are less likely to be lenited, i.e. reduced or suppressed. Being in a strong position leads to stronger constriction for the consonants and more opening for the vowels, resulting in a larger articulatory contrast between the onset consonant and the following vowel and to less coarticulatory phenomena. For a review on experimental studies on the effect of prosodic status on the speech organs, see Fougeron 1999.

- The F-pattern for a phoneme is the result of the coarticulation of the tongue and lip configurations of the surrounding phonemes and those required for the phoneme (Öhman 1966). The direction and extent of coarticulatory overlapping are language-specific (Manuel 1990) and depend on a number of factors, such as the duration of the phoneme and the prosodic status of the phoneme. Coarticulation leads to the neutralisation of certain contrasts in given contexts, and possible sound changes.

- The effect of coarticulation, and well described phenomena such as palatalization, or pharyngealization can be accounted for by similar principles. The F-pattern of consonants with a secondary articulation, such as palatalized or pharyngealized consonants, show the same influences relative to the F-pattern for the consonants with a single place of constriction. Palatalization, labialisation and retroflexion modify the effective length of the front cavity, and therefore the frication part of stops and fricatives. Pharyngealization, on the contrary, causes a minor change to the resonance patterns in front of the main constriction because the secondary place of articulation is at the larynx and does not have much influence on the shape of the front cavity (Fant 1960: 219). Table 3 summarizes these effects. A fronted position of the tongue due to the phonological palatalization of consonants (such as in Russian, see Fant 1960: 220-221; Fant 1973: 69), or to surrounding front phonemes, always has the effect of lowering F1 (such as in /tat/, where /a/ tends to be perceived as /ɛ/ if extracted), and to raise the formants due to the front cavity (generally F2) (such as in /tut/, where /u/ is centralized). Similarly, a backed position of the tongue due to phonological pharyngealization (as in Arabic) or to surrounding back phonemes always has the effect of raising F1 (as in /ʁuʁ/, where /u/ tends to be perceived as /o/ if extracted) and to lower the formants due to the back cavity(front!!?).
  <img src="img/2019-06-11-11-06-52.png">

### consonnants

- Other parameters pertaining to the length and shape of the constriction may improve the modelling (Maeda 1996; Fant and Båvegård 1997) but such details are not relevant for our present purpose. As for vowels and glides, the F-pattern for stops and fricatives contains about 5 resonances up to 5 kHz (see for example Fant 1973:100-139 for calculations of the F-pattern of stops in CV syllables).

1973 Speech Sounds and Features. Cambridge. MA and London, UK: MIT Press

- In contrast to oral vowels, the entire F-pattern is not excited in fricatives and stops.
- Simplifying slightly, we can consider that only the resonances due to the cavity between the constriction and the lips are excited. The effective length of that cavity depends on lip rounding and protrusion, on the front-back position of the tongue and on the shape of the constriction.
- Depending on **the shape of the constriction**, for example, the type of resonance may be a half-wavelength type (as for /t/) or a quarter-wavelength type (as for /k/). For the same length of the cavity, half-wavelength type resonances are twice as high as quarter-wavelength type resonances.
- Large compensation manoeuvers are therefore possible, which are easy to understand. Figure 3 (top) represents the resonances due to the front cavity on the nomogram illustrated in Figure 1. As the constriction moves from the lips (no formants excited) to the pharyngeal region, the cavity in front of the constriction tends to become longer, and as a consequence of this, lower and lower formants are excited.
- The lower formants up to F5 are not excited during the labials, because there is no front cavity.
- The formants above F5 are excited for the anterior consonants (dental and alveolar).
- F3 is excited in the case of postalveolar constriction and F2 in the case of a pharyngeal constriction;
- again, F3 is excited when the constriction is close to the root, e.g. for /ɦ/
- Note that the lower resonance in the case of /ku/ as compared to /k/, which has a more backed constriction, is most likely due to rounding: the length of the front cavity is longer in the case of /ku/ than in the case of /kɑ/.
  <img src="img/2019-06-11-10-58-07.png">
  <img src="img/2019-06-11-10-58-07.png">
- Depending on the relative size of the constriction area and the glottis opening, approximants may become fricatives and vice versa. For example, the realisation /j/ may be accompanied by noise if the constriction is made tighter: the higher formants are excited by the noise and the lower formants by the glottal source; the creation of noise is not favourable to the maintenance of voicing; it may be devoiced and become acoustically a fricative (only the formants in front of the constriction are excited). Uvular and pharyngeal fricatives, when voiced, have the characteristics of approximants (Yeou and Maeda 1995), etc. The tendency for the constriction of a consonant to be tighter or less tight than expected, and the opening of the glottis depends on the prosodic status of the phoneme.

Yeou, Mohamed and Shinji Maeda 1995Uvular and pharyngeal consonants are approximants: An acoustic modelling and study. Proceedings of the XIIIth International Congress of Phonetic Sciences, Stockholm: 586-589.

### vowels

#### glides

- /j/, /ɥ/, /ɺ/, /ʁ/, /w/ have F-patterns similar to /i/, /y/, /ɚ/, /ɑ/ and /u/, with clustered formants. The formant frequencies of glides are more extreme: as the constriction is made tighter in the front region of the vocal tract, F2 gets higher than for the corresponding vowel; when the constriction is closer to the glottis (as for /ʁ/ and /w/), it gets lower (on the effect of reducing a constriction, see Fant 1960: 81).

- When extracted from the sequences /iji/, /yɥy/, /ɚɺɚ/, /ɑʁɑ/, /uwu/, the portions corresponding to /j/, /ɥ/, /ʁ/, /ɺ/, /w/ are respectively identified as the vowels /i/, /y/, /ɚ/, /ɑ/ and /u/.

- The palatal approximant /j/, palatal fricatives, palatalized liquid /ʎ/, and palatalized allophones of /l/ or /g/ share a low F1 and high F2, and (F3F4) are often clustered. Their acoustic similarity is generally not perceived. However, if the consonantal portion of /lili/ is extracted and presented to naïve listeners, it is perceived as having a vowel quality close to /i/. Similarly, if some portion of the glide /j/ is left before /i/, the stimulus is perceived as [gi] (Vaissière, 2006).

<img src="img/2019-06-11-10-39-43.png">

#### others

- The three other front primary vowels C2, C3 and C4 (e ɛ a) do not correspond to a less constricted VT [13]. These vowels are more difficult to define in acoustic terms. They have in common two peaks of equal strength above F1 and no focalization.
  MA and London, UK: MIT Press.
  [13] Fant, G., Båvegård, M. 1997. Parametric model of VT area functions: Vowels and consonants. Speech, Music and Hearing – Quarterly Progress Status Report: Stockholm 38(1), 1-20
  Creating the series /C2/e/, C3/ǫ ǫ / and C4/a/ Unlike for the vowels described above, no formants are regrouped for these vowels. The constricted part is less narrow (Fant and Båvegård 1997) than for the focal vowels. Since they are not focal, and do not correspond to turning points, these vowels are more difficult to define in acoustic terms.

- To keep the first two formants close together, the tongue constriction has to move back from /u o ɔ ɑ/ synchronously with the delabialization gesture. X-ray data show that the continuum /u o ɔ ɑ/ corresponds to a backing of the constriction and not to an increase in the area of the constriction (Wood 1979).

- When the constriction is in the back region of the vocal tract, jaw opening has much less effect on the formants than when it is in the front.
- Strictly speaking, the vocal tract is as “closed” for /ɑ/ as for /u/ (tongue), but the highest point of the tongue is actually higher for /u/ than for //.

#### focal vowels (Vaissiere2011Hongkong+proposal2011)

- It is based on the notion of the Fpattern defined by Fant (1960) and the use of Maeda’s model to explore the maximal articulatory and F-pattern spaces.
- The real time visualisation of the formants when he/she tries to utter the point vowels as defined in the present article is very useful. The vowels in his/her own language may be located relative to these point vowels. The point vowels may then be used for speaker normalisation. The point vowels as defined here may go beyond the extreme vowels produced by the speaker in his/her native language, even when its vocalic triangle is maximally stretched.
- The points of converging formants are called focal points and correspond to quantal regions :
  relatively large changes in position of the constriction around the focal points will cause little change in the acoustic signal (at least for the frequency of the two formants concerned).
- When two formants converge, there is also an increase in their amplitude of 6 dB per halving their distance (Fant 1960:58).

- Two close formants are perceived as a single formant (Chistovich and Lublinskaya 1979).

- when two formants are converging, one of the converging formants may be extremely sensitive to both lip configuration and degree of constriction.
  The sensitivity of F3 to lip rounding for the very front constriction is employed to contrast /i/ and /y/ by lowering F3 (note that /i/ and /y/ have about the same F1 and F2, they differ by F3). The sensitivity of degree of constriction is employed to create glides, such as /j/, at every point where formants converge (see later).
- why focals ?
  Are they any easier to recognize than other vowels? Are their coarticulatory properties any different? What is their distribution among the world‟s languages?
  As for the distribution across languages, focal (“quantal”) vowels do not appear to be particularly common.

- i F3F43200 (see nomogram)
  F3 is a half-wave resonance (no close end ???) of the front cavity, which is made as short as possible to obtain the highest possible F3 value.
  In that position, neither F1 (a Helmholtz resonance) nor F2 (a half-wavelength resonance of the back cavity) is independently controllable.
  F2 and F3 correspond to two half-wavelength resonances, the type of resonances that produces the highest resonance frequency.

  - When the constriction is very fronted, i.e. in the prepalatal region, F3 reaches a maximum (transcribed as ⇑). F3 is affiliated to the front cavity (indicated by underlining in our notation), which is made as short as possible
  - Articulatory modeling shows that the tongue has to be placed parallel to the palate to create a halfwave-length resonance, the type of resonance which creates the highest frequency.
  - F2 is not maximal. The vowel fits well to the CVs uttered by PL and DJ(????), and to the /i/ of French [37] and Swedish [12].

  - Note that focal vowels seem to be as sensitive to coarticulation as non-focal vowels [31][36]. Figure 7 illustrates the spectrograms corresponding to the central portion of the vowel [i], in isolation, and in uvular context.
    **When the vowel is surrounded by [ʁ], the length of the front cavity increases, and the front cavity resonance (here: F3) tends to decrease in frequency. F1 tends to increase and /i/ sounds close to [e].**

- y F2F31900
  DJ‟s [y] does not sound as [y] (similar remark for DJ‟s [ø]); observe that there is a lack of F2 and F3 merging in DJ‟s [y](F2F3) 1900Hz corresponds to the narrowest passage in the prepalatal region (the second highest circle in Fig. 4), where F3 is most sensitive to rounding, and the lips are rounded.

  **In the transition from [i] to [y], F2 becomes a resonance of the front cavity.** (cavity switching)

  (F2↓F3) 1900Hz also corresponds to the narrowest passage in the prepalatal region, where F3 is most sensitive to rounding. For the production of /y/, the lips are rounded, but moderately protruded when compared to the rounding necessary to create the cardinal vowel /u/. The lengthening of the front cavity allows for an abrupt decrease in F3 frequency. F3 becomes clustered with F2, creating a spectral peak around 1900 Hz, then F2 will become a resonance of the front cavity. Further protrusion of the lips would lower F2 and there would be no clustering with F3, resulting in a vowel quality that would not sound like /y/. F

- Languages contrasting [i] and [y] seem to prefer a prepalatal position for both [41].
  [41] Wood, S. 1986. The acoustical significance of tongue, lip, and larynx maneuvers in rounded palatal vowels. J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 80, 391-401.
- ɑ F1F21000
  PL‟s [a] has a concentration of energy around 1000 Hz due the grouping of F1 and F2, while for DJ and FR, the F2 of [a] is at a mid distance between F1 and F3
  It corresponds to the highest **possible clustering** of the two first formants.

  **A constriction at the root of the tongue leads to an even higher F1 and an /æ /like sound [13]**, **with a separation of F1 and F2** (see nomogram).

  ⇑(F1↓F2) 1000Hz is a sound where F1 is very high and still clustered with F2, creating a sharp peak around 1000 Hz. F1 is not exactly maximal, and F2 could be made lower. The location of the constriction corresponds to the highest clustering (F1F2). Note that a constriction at the root of the tongue leads to an even higher F1 (see Figure 1), but to a separation of F1 and F2, since it raises the frequency of F2. A constriction at the root creates an /æ/-like sound (Fant and Båvegård 1997).

  C5[ɑ], [a] and [æ] share a high F1, but strictly speaking, only C5[] is a quantal vowel. In the two other vowels, the first two formants are separated and do not sound like a “back” vowel.

- ɔ F1F2800
- o F1F2600
  As stated by DJ, the two other back vowels may be created as equidistant from Cardinal C8 [u] and Cardinal C5 [ɑ].

  **For keeping F1F2 clustered, the tongue constriction has to move back from C8 to C5 synchronously with a delabialization gesture(????).**

- u F1F2 400
  Fant, Gunnar, and Mats Båvegård 1997 Parametric model of VT area functions: Vowels and consonants. Speech, Music and Hearing- Quarterly Progress Status Report: Stockholm. 38(1): 1 -20.
  (↓F1⇓F2) 400Hz corresponds to the narrowest passage in the middle of the vocal tract (at about 6.5 cm, Fant and Båvegård 1997).
  F1F2 clustering corresponds to the lowest possible concentration of energy. F1 and F2 correspond to two Helmholtz resonances, the type of resonances that produces the lowest resonance frequency. It requires two strong constrictions, at the lip and at the middle of the mouth.
  The vowel corresponds to DJ‟s and PL‟s CV [u]

A strong rounding of the lips allows for a decrease in F2, which reaches its minimum.

F2 of /u/ may be considered mainly as a resonance of the front cavity (Fant 1960: 211)

Strictly speaking, the narrowest passage for /u/ is much fronter than for //, in the velar region. (↓F1⇓F2) 400Hz corresponds to Jones’s cardinal vowel /u/, to its rendition by Ladefoged, to the French and Swedish vowel /u/, but not to the English /u/, which usually has a higher F2. French /u/ does not have the same spectral quality as Spanish /u/, which is close to French /o/.

- ɚ

[ɚ]= (F2⇓F3) 1500Hz is not among the CVs. Nonetheless, it represents an extreme in terms of a low F3, which gets as low as 1,500 Hz. The production of (F2⇓F3) 1500Hz is achieved by

Three constrictions are necessary for the production of such a low F3 since there are three points along the vocal tract where the volume velocity nodes of F3 are located (Chiba and Kajiyama 1941). The production of (F2⇓F3) 1500Hz is achieved by a constriction in the pharyngeal region, lip rounding and a bunching of the tongue toward a node corresponding to the third resonance.

- a constriction in the pharyngeal region
- plus lip rounding and
- a bunching of the tongue.

- Note that focal vowels seem to be as sensitive to coarticulation as non-focal vowels [31][36]. Figure 7 illustrates the spectrograms corresponding to the central portion of the vowel [i], in isolation, and in uvular context.

  语言发音模型研究综述
- For pedagogical purpose, it is useful to represent the VT shape corresponding to different vowels by idealized tubes, such as a single tube, two tubes or a fourtube/three-parameter model.
- An articulatory model can be constructed by statistical analysis of mid-sagittal profiles. How can one obtain the sagittal profiles necessary for articulatory modeling? High speed X-ray films give us the best representation of the time-varying VT. Its use is limited by the safe exposure time to X-ray radiations, however. It gives no information about the cross-sectional areas that govern the acoustics. Recent technical progresses have provided many new ways to visualize the VT (see Table 1). MRI is not invasive and it has the great advantage over all other methods of allowing a three-dimensional imaging of the whole VT, therefore to estimate the crosssectional areas. The subject, however, has to sustain phonation and articulation for a rather long time, lying on his/her back. Ultrasound echograph, the least expensive system, is also non invasive, it can be portable. The whole VT is however not visible, the images are often noisy, and the tongue tip is often masked by the shadow of the lower jaw. EMA (ElectroMagnetic Articulography) and X-ray microbeam system tract only movements of a limited number of sensors glued on the surface of the articulators, and data are not so adequate for the construction ofcomprehensive AM (see for a review, description of the European ASPI program).

- Modeling is a useful process for apprehending complex phenomena such as speech. It consists of successive approximations of the production system in terms of space and time by setting the smallest possible number of parameters, as independent as possible.
- It has been verified that such simplified modelling provides a useful approximation of the behavior of formant frequencies (for a comparison between Fant’s nomogram, Maeda’s model and the rendition of the nomogram by phoneticians, see Badin, Perrier and Boë 1990).

- Earlier models that were developed in this spirit are the three-parameter model by Stevens and House (1955), and Fant’s model (1960).

- the three basic components of the models simulating the relationship between articulation and acoustics are: (i) the location of the constriction formed by the tongue or the lips; (ii) the magnitude of the constriction; and (iii) the lip configuration (Stevens and House 1955, Fant 1960).
- More sophisticated models include the shape of the tongue, larynx height, length and shape of the constriction, more details on lip configuration (with a distinction between protrusion and rounding), or side cavities such as the nasal passage and secondary constriction(s) (Maeda 1996; Fant and Båvegård 1997).

- Any mid-sagittal profile (obtained from X-ray or MRI data) can be converted into a cross-sectional area function where the VT is represented by a series of cylindrical sections of averaging area along a straight axis from the glottis to the lips. The area function preserves the resonance characteristics of the VT [11]; the area function is transformed into an acoustic spectral transfer function and the resulting sound is generated and can be heard.

- vocal tract transfer function estimated from x-ray data can be calculated quite accurately from a 4 tubes, 3 parameter model.

[36] Stevens, K.N., House, A.S. 1963. Perturbation of vowels articulations by consonantal context, J. Speech Hearing Res. 6, 111-128.

- The first parameter is the distance from the glottis to the center of the constriction,
- the second is its area, and
- the third is the length-to-opening ratio of the lip tube area. [i], [u] and [ɑ] correspond respectively to a constriction on the front (palatal), mid (velar) and back (pharyngeal) parts of the VT.
- Human speakers can only produce vowels over a range that is less than half that the range represented in Fant's nomograms.

#### stimuli from articulatory modelisation

some details and use for perceptive test

If desired, the area function is able to reproduce the details seen on mid-sagittal profiles; the sagittal profiles may be simplified by the concatenation of simple tubes, for example two connected tubes for [i], [y], [ɑ] or [a], and four connected tubes for [o], [ɔ] and [u][12], [35].
To estimate the sensitivity of each formant to a small or large articulatory change [14], each section of the area function can be **slightly** perturbed (constricted or expanded), and the transfer function calculated.

The synthesized signal can be used as stimulus for perception tests (for details see [27]).

### formants interpretation

#### IPA formant interpretation

- The habit of using only the two first formants to represent vowels still persists, but it is not entirely justified, at least for front vowels: the notion of F′2 has been well established and F3 plays a very large role in languages such as Swedish and French. The correlation between front/back constriction and F2, on the one hand, and high-low and F1, on the other is overestimated, whereas the role of the lips (in determining F2 of the back vowels) and the relative amplitude of the formants (which plays a role for contrasting oral and nasal vowels) is often neglected. The lack of information on F3 and F4 makes it difficult to determine the position of a vowel relative to the cardinal vowels.
- F1 = height, F2 = back
  Ladefoged, P. 1993. A Course in Phonetics. (3rd edition)

- The F1/F2 plot offers a fairly good visual separation of the vowels. But the three articulatory dimensions of the IPA chart (or of Stevens and Fant‟s models, shown in Fig. 4) are reduced to two dimensions, raising the issue of whether two dimensions, such as the two first formant frequency values, can provide an adequate acoustic representation of vowels.

- The answer depends on the location of the concentration of energy on the frequency scale.
  even synthesized to a single formant

#### F pattern

Some discrete breaks in the F-pattern are due to change in type of source, or to sudden coupling of a side cavity, such as the nasal cavity, the tracheal cavity or a lateral cavity (Fant 1960; Stevens [1998] 2000).

#### F2 prime

- F2 prime is called a perceptually relevant formant value
- F2‟ (F2 prime) is an aggregate computed from F2 and higher formants. The F2‟ frequency substitutes a single peak to all formants above F1, aiming to mirror their perceptual integration [4], [6].

- F2 prime more successful
  Fant, G. 1973. Speech Sounds and Features. Cambridge.
- F1 + F2 prime not very natural. It is not really perceptually equivalent to the original.

- estimate the purburbation
  [14] Fant, G., Pauli, S. 1974. Spatial characteristics of vocal tract resonance modes. Proc. Speech Comm. Sem., Stockholm, Sweden, 74, 121-132.
- Generally, when F2 is above 2000 Hz (as in [i e]), F2‟ is higher than F2; it is close to F4 (or even higher) for [i] in languages like Swedish and French where the vowel is characterized by the grouping of F3 and F4 (like the cardinal [i])
- It lies inbetween F2 and F3 for [y], for which F2 and F3 are grouped. When F2 is below 1000 Hz, F1 and F2 are bunched together, and F2‟ is close to F2 (sometimes close to F1 for [u]).
- For Swedish listeners, F′2 is the highest for /i/ (close to the cluster F3F4, closer to F4) and the lowest for /u/ (close to the cluster F1F2 and closer to F1). It is close to the cluster (F2F3) for /y/ and to (F1F2) for // (but closer to F2 than F1) (Carlson, Granström, and Fant 1970).

### Quantal theory (1989)

- The quantal vowels as described in Stevens’s Quantal theory (with converging formants) may not correspond precisely to the most frequent vowels in the world’s languages, but this does not detract from their usefulness as references in the description of vowel systems.

### Maeda modelisation

- In anthropological Maeda’s model, the area function is reconstructed with seven articulatory parameters: one for the jaw position, three for the tongue, two for the lips and one for larynx height. Such an AM makes it possible to evaluate the separate contribution of individual parameters to the vowel formants, and their interaction.
- Such exploration reveals the similarities of the F-pattern among vowels, semi-vowels, and consonants that share a similar tongue position and shape and lip configuration, but differing in the constriction size and shape.
