### Terminology
sound, quickly varying local alterations of air pressure
sound velocity, 340 m/s room temperature (sound molecules remain where they are, higher compressibility = lower velocity, practically not dependent on wind (because the moving of the medium of much slower than the velocity of sound)
intensity, power per unit, spreading loss (everywhere on radius r₁ has the same intensity),surface of a square 4πr², intensity changes inversely proportional to the ratio of the squares of the radii, intensity at 2 meters from source in a office room can be 2 or 3 times as in the free field at the same distance, micro near a wall = factor doubled(standing wave effect)
atmospheric absorption!=spreading loss, viscosity of the molecular structure of the air (toughness),especially higher frequencies, only important when more than 1km
**only valid**
1. for point sources (many sound sources can be considered so if it's small compared to distance)
2. free field (no reflection)

intensity!=microphone records, tranformed to electrical voltages by diaphragm activaed by the sound pressure(SPL=SPLevel, force acting on a surface,1 pascal = 1 newton per square meter)
pressure = force = effect of acoustic power, intensity = power (Watts) = acoustic power, intensity = SPL² (f/m²)

at each point in time the voltage level of the microphone is proportional to the resulting air pressure level of all sound wave interaction
both ears, directions based on time delay (phrase difference), recording with two earphones (enough) = artificial head stereophony, 
perception or impression of sound intensity is not linear(Δ)

representation of sound intensity = decibel (dB), decibel = 0.1bel,1 bel = 10¹ 2 bel = 10²
