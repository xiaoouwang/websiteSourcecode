In this chapter, we explore how language-specific phonotactics might impose constraints on the enhancing gestures that are selected for a universal feature by examining for possible differences in the distribution of the acoustic correlates for the place of nasal articulation in Chinese vs. English nasal codas.
The nasal codas in English and SC may have similar acoustic attributes but the attributes may differ in their distribution due to differences in the phonotactic constraints.

We are interested in how much information, in terms of the acoustic cues related to the nasal place of articulation, is contained in the vowel transition region versus the consonant murmur region in English vs. SC.
