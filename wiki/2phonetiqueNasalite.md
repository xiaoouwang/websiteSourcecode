## articulation

Fujimura (1962) modeled the articulatory system for nasal production as three subsystems that are acoustically coupled to each other at their ends at the velum: the pharynx extending from the glottis to the velum, the oral cavity with a complete closure at the anterior end, and the nasal tract.
A schematization of a nasalized vowel is shown in Figure 2.1 with two outputs, the volume velocity at the mouth, U m, from the main tube and the volume velocity at the nostrils, U n, from the side branch. In the case of a nasal consonant, U m = 0
U s is the source volume velocity at the glottis.

In order to maintain sonorancy, the cross-sectional area of the opening in the velopharyngeal port should be no less than 0.2 to 0.3 cm 2 and the total time from the beginning to the end of the lowering-raising movement of the soft palate is about 200 to 250 ms, based on the timing in a typical utterance in English (Stevens, 1998).

Comparisons of normal and impaired nasal resonance (Warren, Dalston, et al., 1993) have shown that the velopharyngeal opening for nasal consonants must be larger than 0.2 cm 2 for speech to be perceived as normal in adults and that an opening less than 0.2 cm 2 physically restrains airflow through the nose and the speech outcome is often perceived by a listener to be hyponasal

We have discussed that as the cross-sectional area of the velopharyngeal opening increases, the poles also shift to higher frequencies. The zeros of the system with the dimensions specified above for a relatively open vowel, however, depend mainly on the length from the coupling point to the oral closure, and are not affected very much by the change in the size of the velpharyngeal opening.

The presence of the nasal pole at about 1 kHz in a vowel is one acoustic correlate of nasality. The precise location of a nasal pole would depend at least in part on the opening of the velopharyngeal port.

That is, the opening of the velopharyngeal port leads to the greatest change in the acoustics only up to about 0.5 cm 2 . Further opening does not contribute more to the perception of nasality.

Outside of this range, moderate changes in the size of the velopharyngeal opening do not affect very much the acoustics.

### nasal vowels

This is a highly simplified model of the vowel nasalization. The nostrils, which are not part of this model, play an important role in shaping the output at the nose. The nostrils have a smaller cross-sectional area than the rest of the nasal cavity leading up to them, and based on perturbation theory (Stevens, 1998), this constriction will in effect cause a downward shift in all formants.
(1998, acoustic phonetics)

Early models of the acoustics of nasalization (House & Stevens, 1956, Fujimura, 1962), combined with sweep-tone measurements of vocal-tract characteristics (Fujimura & Lindqvist, 1970, Lindqvist & Sundberg, 1976) carried out with stationary articulations of nasal consonants and nasalized vowels have characterized the transfer function of nasalization.

According to the acoustic theory of nasalization for vowels (Fant, 1960; Fujimura and Lindqvist, 1971), the main difference between nasal and oral vowels is that additional formants are introduced as a result of the coupling of the nasal and oral tract.

Sweeptone measurements of the vocal tract transfer functions of nasals and nasalized vowels (Fujimuar & Lindqvist, 1971), combined with the more traditional model of the nasal tract (House and Stevens, 1956, Fujimura, 1960), have provided the basis for the acoustic study of nasalization.

The lowest pole for the transfer function for nasal consonants is estimated to be in the range of 250 to 300 Hz, which is a Helmoholtz resonance between the acoustic compliance of the vocal tract volume and the acoustic mass of the nasal passages, which are convoluted, with extensive surface areas (Chen, 1997). The second pole of the transfer function during the nasal murmur is in the range of 750-1000 Hz.

The production of oral-nasal segments requires a speaker to manipulate the size of the velopharyngeal port to either prevent or enhance the acoustic and aerodynamic coupling of the nasal tract to the oropharyngeal tract (House & Stevens, 1956).

During the interval of a few tens of milliseconds prior to the oral closure and following the release of the nasal consonant, there is coupling of the nasal cavity to the oral cavity and the output is a combination of the volume velocity from the nose and the mouth.

The rapid change in the frequency of the low-frequency prominence at the closure and at the release indicates the nasal landmark in the speech waveform.

The single pole corresponding to the first formant of the non-nasal transfer function is replaced by the pole-zero-pole triplet, the lower pole in the range of 300-900 Hz and the higher one in the range of 600 to 1200 Hz, and the zero usually above the nasal pole.

The zero will reduce the amplitude of the first and second formants. During the period where the vowel is non-nasal preceding the closure or following the release, one of the poles merges with the zero, leaving a single pole that is the first formant of the non-nasal vowel.

(Stevens, 1998). This results in an abrupt increase in spectrum amplitude in the vicinity of the frequency of the second formant.This is the frequency region in which there was a zero during the nasal murmur, which is gone at the release of the nasal.

The reduction in the amplitude of the first formant spectral peak (A1) has been observed to be the primary cue of nasalization. Perceptual experiments using synthetic stimuli showed that lowering F1 amplitude by 6-8 dB is necessary to achieve a significant level of nasality perception (Stevens, 1998).

introduce a pole and a zero in the region of the first formant, and a spectral peak around 1 kHz (House and Stevens, 1956).

Another nasal peak between 250 and 450 Hz has been observed and this has been attributed to the pole-zero pair introduced by the paranasal sinuses (Chen, 1997).

Another acoustic correlate of nasalization is the change in the amplitude of F2 at the discontinuity between the vowel and the nasal murmur.

At the transition from the vowel to the nasal murmur in the vicinity of this landmark, the amplitude of F2 should decrease significantly and F2 should also shift noticeably.

The spectrograms on the top panel of Figure 2.2 show the male English speaker’s production of ‘d@n’ on the left and ‘d@’ on the right. There is an abrupt decrease in the amplitude of F2 at the landmark of the nasal coda, at about 450 ms.

### nasal consonnants (chineseNasalBiblio)

- zeros
  Kurowski and Blumstein (1987) found that there is less change in energy in the region of Bark 5-7 (395-770Hz) relative to that of Bark 11-14 (1265-2310Hz) for /n/ than for /m/. Since the Bark 5-7 and Bark 11-14 regions respectively encompass the first nasal zeros of /m, n/, the energy reduction difference in the two nasals, /m, n/ is largely due to the first nasal zero influence.
  larger energy reduction for /n/ than for /ŋ/ in the low-mid frequency (<3000Hz) region due to the higher first nasal zero value for /ŋ/ (> 3000Hz) than for /n/ (<3000Hz).
- formants
  the first, second, and third nasal formants (N1, N2, & N3) of all nasals have a s imilar frequency level respectively at 250Hz, 2500Hz, and 3250Hz (Ladefoged, 2001), they are generally not good nasal place cues.

Previous physiological studies seem to agree that “there is strong interaction between oral and nasal sounds” (Chafcouloff & Marchal, 1999, p. 70). For example, Chen’s (2000) acoustic study of Mandarin VN production finds that when followed by /ŋ/, the three vowels /i, a, ə/ tend to move backward.

Recasens’ (1983) study of Catalan VN# found that m is 78ms long (the preceding vowel is 75ms long), but n is only 62 ms long (the preceding vowel is 87ms long). Chen (1972) also claimed that Mandarin /ŋ/ is two times longer than /n/. However, Chen (1972) did not provide acoustic evidence to support his claim.

Because open (low) vowels are longer than close (high) vowels, and /ŋ/ is longer than /n/, V open ŋ (an open vowel followed by ŋ) and V close n (a close vowel followed by n) may respectively have the longest and shortest duration among the four types of VN rimes, V open ŋ, V open n, V close ŋ, and V close n.

## Perception

**hehe, regarde nouvelles directions en phonologie ?**
La perception du voisement est catégorielle (Liberman et al. 1957) : au même point d’articulation, une consonne est perçue comme /p/ ou /b/, il n’y a pas d’intermédiaire. Cependant, les locuteurs/auditeurs ont la capacité de juger la qualité des réalisations des sons produits et de déterminer s’ils sont de bons ou de mauvais exemplaires de la catégorie. Kuhl (1991) fait l’hypothèse qu’il existerait pour chaque phonème un prototype, une sorte de meilleure réalisation possible de la catégorie. Plus une réalisation s’éloigne de ce prototype, moins elle est perçue comme un bon exemplaire.
